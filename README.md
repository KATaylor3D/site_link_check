# site_link_check
Used to check if all the links in a given website return an error code
### Directions
* Change to the directory that contains the 'check_site_links.py'
* Run the code using 'python3 check_site_links.py'
### What to expect
* The command prompt will clear and then ask 'Website to check: '
* From here enter your website url including the __'https://'__
* Then it will return either a list of broken link titles or a response saying 'Didn't find any problem links'
## Background
*My fiance's job gave her a task to check if all the links in one of their clients websites was working. So I said, "You know I could do that in like 40 lines of code". And here we are with 50 lines of code...

# Update
Enjoying the side project more than I thought so I decided to add some more __QoL__ code. Definitly not going to hit that 50 lines mark
